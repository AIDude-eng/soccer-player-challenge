## Coding Challenge Junior Developer

This is my result of the datavisyn Coding Challenge for Junior Developers.

To get started, Node.js and npm have to be installed.

<br>
The Project was created with the React App Library and the typescript extension using:
<br><br>

`npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`

It can be started with npm:

`npm start`
