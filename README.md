## Coding Challenge Junior Developer

This is my result of the datavisyn Coding Challenge for Junior Developers.

To get started, Node.js and npm have to be installed.


The Project was created with the React App Library and the typescript extension using: 

`npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript`

It can be started with npm:

`npm start`
