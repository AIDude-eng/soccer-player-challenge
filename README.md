This is my result of the [datavisyn](https://datavisyn.io/) Coding Challenge for Junior Developers.

To get started, Node.js and npm have to be installed.

The Project was created with the React App Library and the typescript extension using:

#### `npx create-react-app soccer-player-challenge --template typescript`

Before use, dependencies must be installed with:

#### `npm install`

Start the project with:

#### `npm start`
